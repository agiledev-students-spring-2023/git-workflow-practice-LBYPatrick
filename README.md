## Why this matters

> ~~Maybe it doesn't~~

This is my personal favorite for formatting `commit messages`. I have used this standard for the past hundreds of commits or so across some of my past projects and it has turned out to be **clean** and **concise**.

And just to make this page look "pretty" per homework requirement:

## My comment (Eduarda)

I can understand how this is a productive way to name commits. Especially since there seems to be a standard about short messages, with some sort of verb, and a specific thing that was verb-ed. There are so many things within agile/scrum that are standardized, so it would make perfect sense that git commits should be too.
